QWinFF is a GUI for FFmpeg [#ffmpeg]_, a command line media converter. FFmpeg
can read audio and video files in various formats and convert them into other
formats.  For example, you can convert video downloaded from the Internet into
audio files for your mobile phone.


QWinFF comes with a set of predefined presets to help you quickly convert media
files without having to know the details. These presets defines what arguments
should be passed to *ffmpeg* for each output format. In case you want to adjust
the details (bitrate, audio volume, etc.), QWinFF lets you edit conversion
parameters for each individual task.

Currently QWinFF runs on GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows [#windows]_.
