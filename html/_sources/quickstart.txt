Quick Start
===========

When you open QWinFF, you will see is the *Main Window*. At the top of the Main
Window is the *Toolbar*, which contains most common operations you will need.
Below the Toolbar is the *Task List*. The Task List is used to display all
conversion tasks. At the bottom-right corner, there is a *Start* button. At the
bottom of the window is the *Status Bar*.

The first thing to do is add some files to convert. You can do it by either
clicking on the *Add* button on the Toolbar or drag-and-drop files into the
Task List. After adding all files you want to convert, an *Add Task* dialog
will appear. You can select the output container format (*Convert To*) and
the output configuration (*Preset*). Then, select the desired output folder and
press *Finish*.

.. note:: You can select multiple files in the *Open File* dialog and add them
   all at once.

When you have added some tasks, click the Start button and the conversion will
start. Conversion progress of each task will be shown in the progress bar entry
in the Task List. After a task is finished, double-click on it to open the
output folder.
